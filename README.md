# What is Aayega?
> Aayega is a promises library which is compliant with promises / A+ spec. 

## What is the inspiration behind it?

1. *Aayega* is meant for educational and learning purposes. 
2. Aayega means "it will come" in hindi language and it is a good term to represent the result of an async operation. 

## What are the goals?
1. Goal is not to learn and implement the specification. 
2. Code readibility is the primary focus so new comers to A+ spec can use this as reference. 
3. Use of ES6 features. 


### All steps taken to reach the final outcome are listed below ::::: 

### Step-1 [ Read the specification ] 

It is advised to read the spec at least 5 times if you're like me :) 

Following is what I got ater going through the spec for a few times.
